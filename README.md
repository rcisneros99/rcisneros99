## Hi there 👋 I'm Rafa!

### About Me

I'm a Data Science Master’s student with a background in Telecommunications Engineering, currently based in San Francisco. With a passion for Quantum Computing, AI and cybersecurity, I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between cutting-edge tech and impactful applications. I’m especially interested in how emerging technologies like Quantum Computing and Genetic Algorithms can redefine what’s possible in fields like AI-driven intelligence, network security, and beyond.

When I’m not deep into coding or research, I’m probably training for a marathon, jamming on my guitar, or exploring new adventure challenges that push my boundaries!
