## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rafa!

### About Me
I'm a Data Science Masterâ€™s student with a background in Telecommunications Engineering, currently based in San Francisco. Passionate about Quantum Computing, AI, and cybersecurity, Iâ€™m fascinated by how emerging tech like Quantum AI and Genetic Algorithms can redefine fields like network security and intelligent systems.

When Iâ€™m not coding or researching, Iâ€™m training for a marathon, playing guitar, or seeking new challenges that push my limits!
